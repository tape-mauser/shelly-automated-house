Welcome to the Automated Exhibition House project! This repository showcases a fully functional smart home setup using Shelly modules. The house is equipped with four Shelly modules, which control the gate, shutters, and lighting, providing an automated and seamless experience.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of IoT technology in a modern exhibition house setting. The key features include:

Automated Gate: The gate can be controlled remotely, allowing for easy access and enhanced security.
Smart Shutters: Control the shutters automatically or remotely to adjust the light and privacy levels in the house.
Lighting Control: The house's lighting system is fully automated, providing customized lighting scenes based on time or user preferences.
Modules Used
### Shelly plus 1PM: Utilized for the lighting system, enabling smooth dimming and on/off control.
### Shelly plus 2PM: Deployed for managing the shutters, allowing for both automation and manual control.
### Shelly Plus 1: Used to control the gate, ensuring precise and reliable operation. 
### Shelly wall display: Provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and controlling the entire system from a central location.


## How It Works
The house is connected through a local Wi-Fi network, where each Shelly module is configured via the Shelly app or a home automation platform like Home Assistant. Users can interact with the system through their smartphones or integrate it with voice assistants for hands-free control.

## Installation
Hardware Setup: Install the Shelly modules in the designated locations (gate, shutters, lights).
Configuration: Connect the modules to your Wi-Fi network using the Shelly app.
Automation: Set up automation rules and schedules based on your preferences.
Monitoring: Use the Shelly app or a home automation dashboard to monitor and control the system.
